# ESP32 - IOT2TANGLE

**ESP32** is one of the microcontrollers for *IoT applications* par excellence. Created and manufactured by *Espressif*, it is widely used for both educational and industrial development due to its great versatility, reliability and low cost. At *I2T* we wanted to add it due to its extensive use in the development community.

## Available connectivity
- **[HTTP-receiver](https://github.com/lukinias/iot_pet_feeder/tree/main/ESP32/http-receiver)** -- ESP32 will receive the data through HTTP from **[Keepy](https://github.com/iot2tangle/Keepy)** and performs actions based on the data received (for now it is optimized only to work with Keepy).
